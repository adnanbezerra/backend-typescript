##  :clipboard: Description

That's a simple, very basic TypeScript back-end server template. It's meant for being used as a basis for my personal projects, but I believe it can also
be used by other people. Of course, it follows best my personal likings; still, it's a completely functional server by itself, and  useful
for a broader use.

It's configured with JWT usage, testing support with Jest, Prisma ORM installed, schema validating with Joi and some really useful basic middlewares, including
a really smooth error middleware, and layered architecture.

## üèÅ Running the server

This project was made using [ExpressJS](https://github.com/expressjs/express), so you must have the latest stable versions of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) running correctly in your machine.

Once you have cloned this repository into your own GitHub and then cloning it to your computer, you must open the respective project directory in you terminal
and then run:

```
npm install
```

Now, you must configure your `.env` file. You must copy what's inside of `.env.example`, create a `.env` file, past the copied informations and fill in the required
variables.

Now, you can finally run your server locally by running this command:
```
npm start
```

:stop_sign: If you want to, visit [this repository](https://github.com/adnanbezerra/template-frontend) and pay a visit to the front-end application template with
React. It already has a router, some basic structures, reset CSS and other pretty useful features to make your front-end programming easier and faster!
